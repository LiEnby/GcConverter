# GcConverter
Tools to convert GC dumps to different formats.

can convert .VCI to .PSV.

and .PSV to .VCI (requires a gc keyfile, .psv doesn't contain enough information on its own for this)

and can create a nonpdrm dump from a PSV or VCI image, using gc2nonpdrm.

gc2nonpdrm requires FATtools
install with
``pip install FATtools``
